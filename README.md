## Introduction
The Income Tax Law 2009 has modified some applications of the wage withholding tax. This guide outlines those changes and provides assistance in complying with the law.

## Who Must Withhold?
Legal and natural persons with two or more employees during any month of the tax year must withhold tax from employees whose income exceeds the threshold discussed in Article 58 of the Income Tax Law. Legal entities include partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies, government agencies, and charitable institutions.

## What Payments are Subject to Withholding?
Payments to employees in the form of salaries and wages for work provided are subject to withholding. This includes regular pay, overtime pay, cash allowances (e.g., food and transportation), and non-cash payments for services. Refer to Public Ruling 1384/6 for detailed information.

## Who is Subject to Withholding?
All resident and non-resident employees in Afghanistan whose salaries exceed the tax threshold of AFN 5000 per month or equivalent. Non-resident employees are exempt if their home country provides the same exemption to Afghan residents. Refer to agreements, treaties, or protocols for foreign government and international organization employees.

## Employee vs. Independent Contractor
For tax purposes, employees are liable for wage withholding tax while independent contractors are not. Determination is based on the nature of service provision rather than the contract terms. Refer to Public Ruling 1385/5 for more information.

## Resident vs. Non-Resident
A natural person is a resident of Afghanistan if:
1. The principal home is in Afghanistan at any time during the year.
2. The person is present in Afghanistan for 183 days in the tax year.
3. The person is an employee or official of the Afghan government posted abroad.

Non-residents are taxed on Afghan-source income only.

Effective 1 Hamal 1388, the new tax law provides a monthly schedule of withholding rates based on income brackets.

## Calculation of Wage Withholding Tax
Use the provided tables to calculate the withholding tax based on the payroll period and total salary, including taxable benefits. Examples are provided in the document for better understanding.

### Example 1
Abdullah earns AFN 20,000 per month. His monthly withholding rate would be AFN 900 based on the following calculation from the third row of the monthly payroll table:

20,000 â€“ 12,500 = 7,500
7,500 x 10% (0.1) = 750
750 + 150 = 900


### Example 2
Joe Brown earns the equivalent of AFN 55,000 twice a month. His withholding rate would be AFN 5,450 on a semi-monthly basis based on the following calculation from the fourth row of the semi-monthly payroll table:



## Reporting and Payment
Employers must remit the withheld tax to the State no later than 10 days after the end of the month. Annual salary and tax statements must be provided to employees and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. Monthly wage withholding reports and deposit forms must be filed with payments due at Da Afghanistan Bank.

### Example 3
ABC Inc., a foreign firm, pays its foreign employees working in Afghanistan bi-weekly. However, the firm pays its local employees on a monthly basis. The firm would be required to withhold from each group of employees on each separate pay date, but file and pay the withheld tax within 10 days of the end of the month.

### Example 4
XYZ Inc., another foreign firm, pays its foreign employees semi-monthly and its local employees monthly. This firm would also have one filing requirement per month.

## Employee's Responsibility
Employees with a single job have no further filing requirements. Those with additional income must file an individual income tax return and can credit the withheld tax against their total tax liability.

## Enforcement Provisions
Non-compliance may result in administrative actions by the Ministry of Finance, including fines, penalties, and prosecution.
