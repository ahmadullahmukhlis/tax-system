#Income Tax Law Guide
Introduction
The Income Tax Law 2009 has introduced changes to the wage withholding tax. This guide explains those changes to help you comply with the law.

Who Must Withhold Tax?
Legal and natural persons with two or more employees during any month of the tax year must withhold tax if employee income exceeds the threshold. Legal persons include partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies, organizations, agencies, ministries, government departments, state enterprises, municipalities, and charitable institutions.

Payments Subject to Withholding
Withholding applies to salaries and wages, including regular pay, overtime pay, cash allowances (e.g., food and transportation), and non-cash payments for services. Detailed information is available in Public Ruling 1384/6 on the Ministry of Finance and Afghanistan Revenue Department websites.

Resident vs. Non-Resident Employees
Resident employees: Subject to withholding if income exceeds AFN 5000 per month or equivalent.
Non-resident employees: Subject to withholding unless exempted by their home country's reciprocal arrangements.
Employee vs. Independent Contractor
Employees: Liable to wage withholding tax.
Independent contractors: Not liable for wage withholding but must pay annual income tax.
The status is determined by the nature of service provision, not just the contract terms.

Employee Responsibility
Employees with a single job have no further filing requirements. Those with additional income must file an individual income tax return and can credit withheld tax against their total tax liability.

Enforcement Provisions
Non-compliance may result in fines, penalties, and legal action as per Chapters 14 and 16 of the Income Tax Law.
