Introduction
The Income Tax Law 2009 has changed some of the 
applications of the wage withholding tax. This guide will 
explain those changes and help you in complying with 
the law.
Who must withhold?
Legal persons and natural persons (individuals) with two 
or more employees during any month of the tax year are 
required to withhold tax from employees whose income 
exceeds the threshold, discussed later (Article 58 
Income Tax Law). Legal persons include partnerships, 
corporations, limited liability companies, organizations, 
agencies, ministries and other national or local government 
agencies and departments, enterprises of the State and 
municipalities, and charitable institutions. 
What payments are subject to withholding?
Payments to employees in the form of salaries and wages 
for work provided are subject to withholding. Salaries 
and wages include: regular pay for services, overtime 
pay, cash allowances provided by the employer to the 
employee (including, but not limited to, food allowances 
and transportation allowances), and non-cash payments 
for services. For more detailed information regarding which 
payments are subject to withholding, see Public Ruling 
1384/6 posted on the Ministry of Finance website at http://
www.mof.gov.af or on the Afghanistan Revenue Department 
website at http://www.ard.gov.af 
Who is subject to withholding?
All resident and non-resident employees working in 
Afghanistan whose salaries and wages exceed the tax 
threshold of AFN 5000 (or equivalent in foreign currency) 
per month or equivalent pro-rated amounts for those paid 
on alternate payroll periods. Non-resident employees are

process.

exempt from withholding if their home country provides 
the same exemption to residents of Afghanistan. Resident 
and non-resident employees of foreign governments and 
international organizations are subject to tax based on 
existing agreements, treaties or protocols with the State. 
Who is an employee? Who is an independent 
contractor?
It is important to distinguish between employees and 
independent contractors for tax purposes. Employees 
will be liable to wage withholding tax while independent 
contractors will not. Independent contractors will however 
still be liable to annual income tax.
The Income Tax Law 2009 does not provide a definition 
of employee or independent contractor. Instead, it is a 
question of fact decided on the basis of the nature and 
circumstances of the provision of an individual’s services 
rather than solely on the contract itself or the terms used 
in a contract. Other factors taken into account include the 
degree of control over the manner of the work, the payment 
arrangement, flexibility of place of work, reporting, provision 
of tools and equipment, duration of relationship, etc.
For more detailed information regarding the determination 
of employee or independent contractor status for tax 
purposes, see Public Ruling 1385/5 posted on the Ministry 
of Finance website at http://www.mofgov.af/tax or the 
Afghanistan Revenue Department website at http://www.
ard.gov.af.
Who is a resident? Who is a non-resident?
According to the Income Tax Law, a natural person is a 
resident of Afghanistan (Article 2) for the tax year if: 
3
1) The person has his or her principal home in Afghanistan 
at any time during the year; or
2) The person is present in Afghanistan for a period of 
183 days in the tax year; or 
3) The person is an employee or an official of the 
Government of Afghanistan posted abroad at any time 
during the tax year. 
Non-residents are those people who do not meet the 
above requirements. All Afghan-source income is taxable 
for non-residents. Afghan-source income is defined as 
any income directly produced in Afghanistan or paid for 
services provided in Afghanistan regardless of the period 
over which those services were provided. 
Example 1: Joe Brown is a resident of the United Kingdom 
where he maintains his principal home. He arrived in 
Kabul for a 12 month assignment working as an employee 
for a non-profit British aid organization. There is no 
agreement with the State in place to exempt employees of 
his organization from taxation in Afghanistan. He is paid in 
pounds sterling from his home office in London. The money 
is deposited directly into his British bank account. However, 
his wages are paid for services provided in Afghanistan, 
so they are considered Afghan-source income and would 
be subject to withholding tax in Afghanistan. 
Example 2: Abdul Nasri is an Afghan national who lives 
in Dubai. He spent three months in Kabul working for 
the same British firm as Mr. Brown. Since he does not 
maintain his principal home in Afghanistan, was not in the 
country for at least 183 days, and is not an employee of 
the Afghan government, he is considered a non-resident. 
However, his wages for work in Afghanistan are considered 
Afghan-source income and subject to tax. The British firm 
is required to withhold tax on his wages and pay the tax to 
the Afghan government.
Note
Worldwide income 
is taxable in 
Afghanistan for all 
residents.

What is the rate of withholding?
Effective as of 1 Hamal 1388, the new tax law reduced 
the monthly exemption from AFN 12,500 to AFN 5,000 (or 
pro-rated share for alternate payroll periods) per person. 
The tax law also added a 2 percent tax bracket. The 
Income Tax Law (Article 4) provides a monthly schedule 
of withholding rates. 
For monthly payrolls in AFN
Income up to Tax Income more 
than
0 5,000 0%
5,000 12,500 2% of amount over 5,000
150 + 10% of amount over 
12,500 12,500 100,000
8,900 + 20% of the amount 
over 100,000 100,000
Employees paid on alternate payroll schedules (weekly, 
semi-monthly, etc.) are subject to withholding according to 
the following pro-rated schedules, which are based on the 
monthly schedule.
For semi-monthly payrolls in AFN
Tax Income 
up to

How is wage withholding tax calculated? 
Wage withholding tax is calculated based on the above 
tables. Determine which payroll period you use. For 
each employee, look at the total salary (including taxable 
benefits). If it is in excess of the highest threshold (AFN 
100,000 for monthly payroll, AFN 50,000 for semi-monthly 
payroll, etc.), use the fourth row of the appropriate 
schedule. If the total salary (including taxable benefits) 
is more than the next highest threshold (AFN 12,500 
monthly, AFN 6,250 semi-monthly, etc.), but does not 
6
exceed the highest threshold, use the third row of the 
appropriate schedule. If the total salary (including taxable 
benefits) is more than the lowest threshold (AFN 5,000 
monthly, AFN 2,500, semi-monthly, etc.), but does not 
exceed the second lowest threshold, use the second row 
of the appropriate schedule. If the total salary is less than 
the lower threshold, there is no withholding requirement. 
Example 3: Abdullah earns AFN 20,000 per month. His 
monthly withholding rate would be AFN 900 based on 
the following calculation from the third row of the monthly 
payroll table:
20,000 – 12,500 = 7,500
7,500 x 10% (0.1) = 750
750 + 150 = 900
Example 4: Joe Brown from example 1 earns the 
equivalent of AFN 55,000 twice a month. His withholding 
rate would be AFN 5,450 on a semi-monthly basis based 
on the following calculation from the fourth row of the 
semi-monthly payroll table:
55,000 – 50,000 = 5,000
5,000 x 20% (0.2) = 1,000
1,000 + 4,450 = 5,450
When does the tax withheld have to be paid?
The employer is required to remit to the State the amount 
withheld no later than 10 days after the end of the month 
in which the amounts were withheld (Article 60).
Example 5: ABC Inc., a foreign firm, pays its foreign 
employees working in Afghanistan bi-weekly. However, 
the firm pays its local employees on a monthly basis. The 
firm would be required to withhold from each group of 
employees on each separate pay date, but file and pay 
the withheld tax within 10 days of the 
7
end of the month.
Example 6: XYZ Inc., another foreign firm, pays its foreign 
employees semi-monthly and its local employees monthly. 
This firm would also have one filing requirement per month.
How is wage withholding tax reported? 
Annual salary and tax statement: The employer must 
give each employee an annual salary and tax statement 
showing the employer’s name, address and employer 
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); the employee’s 
name, address, and employee’s TIN; and the amount of 
the employee’s total salary or wage, as well as the amount 
withheld. A copy of this annual statement will be forwarded 
to the Ministry of Finance as well (Article 61).
Annual summary report of tax withheld: The employer will 
file an annual summary of all wages or salaries paid to 
all employees during the tax year and all taxes withheld 
(Article 61).
Wage withholding report and deposit form: This form must 
be completed and filed within 10 days of the end of the 
month in which the salaries were paid, reporting total 
wages or salaries paid for the month and taxes withheld. 
Payment is due in afghanis at Da Afghanistan Bank with 
the form (Article 60). 
What is the employee’s responsibility? 
If the employee has only one job he/she has no further 
responsibility or filing requirements. The Ministry of 
Finance will receive the appropriate information through 
the employer’s annual summary report filing.
If the employee has other income (including, but not limited 
to, another job, self-employment, dividends, rental income, 
etc.) he/she must file an individual income tax return and 
calculate his/her total tax for the year. He/she will be able 
to take credit for any tax withheld against his/her total tax 
liability (Article 63).

Talking to your employees about withholding tax
Changes to the tax law and tax rates have resulted in 
higher amounts of withheld tax for many employees, 
and new withholding requirements for many more. It is 
important to explain to employees that the income tax 
requirement has been a part of Afghan tax law for years, 
and that compliance with the withholding tax is a legal 
requirement under the Income Tax Law 2009. 
If your employees have questions regarding the wage 
withholding specifically, or income tax filing in general, 
please direct them to contact the Afghanistan Revenue 
Department. If you would prefer to have a representative 
of the Afghanistan Revenue Department come to your 
place of business to address your employees regarding 
these or other tax issues, please contact the Afghanistan 
Revenue Department or your Mustufiat to arrange a 
convenient time.
Enforcement provisions
Failure to comply with the requirements of the Income 
Tax Law may result in the Ministry of Finance using 
administrative powers within the tax law to ensure 
compliance. These provisions are contained in Chapters 
14 and 16 of the Income Tax Law and include fines, 
penalties and referral to the Attorney General’s office for 
prosecution.
