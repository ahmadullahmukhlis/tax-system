          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The Income Tax Law 2009 has modified some applications of the wage
            withholding tax. This guide outlines those changes and provides
            assistance in complying with the law.
          </p>

          <h2 id="who-must-withhold">Who Must Withhold?</h2>
          <p>
            Legal and natural persons with two or more employees during any
            month of the tax year must withhold tax from employees whose income
            exceeds the threshold discussed in Article 58 of the Income Tax Law.
            Legal entities include partnerships, corporations, limited liability
            companies, government agencies, and charitable institutions.
          </p>

          <h2 id="what-payments-are-subject-to-withholding">
            What Payments are Subject to Withholding?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Payments to employees in the form of salaries and wages for work
            provided are subject to withholding. This includes regular pay,
            overtime pay, cash allowances (e.g., food and transportation), and
            non-cash payments for services. Refer to Public Ruling 1384/6 for
            detailed information.
          </p>

          <h2 id="who-is-subject-to-withholding">
            Who is Subject to Withholding?
          </h2>
          <p>
            All resident and non-resident employees in Afghanistan whose
            salaries exceed the tax threshold of AFN 5000 per month or
            equivalent. Non-resident employees are exempt if their home country
            provides the same exemption to Afghan residents. Refer to
            agreements, treaties, or protocols for foreign government and
            international organization employees.
          </p>

          <h2 id="employee-vs-independent-contractor">
            Employee vs. Independent Contractor
          </h2>
          <p>
            For tax purposes, employees are liable for wage withholding tax
            while independent contractors are not. Determination is based on the
            nature of service provision rather than the contract terms. Refer to
            Public Ruling 1385/5 for more information.
          </p>

          <h2 id="resident-vs-non-resident">Resident vs. Non-Resident</h2>
          <p>A natural person is a resident of Afghanistan if:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The principal home is in Afghanistan at any time during the year.
            </li>
            <li>
              The person is present in Afghanistan for 183 days in the tax year.
            </li>
            <li>
              The person is an employee or official of the Afghan government
              posted abroad.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Non-residents are taxed on Afghan-source income only.</p>

          <h2 id="withholding-rates">Withholding Rates</h2>
          <p>
            Effective 1 Hamal 1388, the new tax law provides a monthly schedule
            of withholding rates based on income brackets.
          </p>

          <h2 id="calculation-of-wage-withholding-tax">
            Calculation of Wage Withholding Tax
          </h2>
          <p>
            Use the provided tables to calculate the withholding tax based on
            the payroll period and total salary, including taxable benefits.
            Examples are provided in the document for better understanding.
          </p>

          <h3>Example 1</h3>
          <p>
            Abdullah earns AFN 20,000 per month. His monthly withholding rate
            would be AFN 900 based on the following calculation from the third
            row of the monthly payroll table:
          </p>
          <pre>
            20,000 – 12,500 = 7,500
            7,500 x 10% (0.1) = 750
            750 + 150 = 900
                </pre
          >

          <h2 id="reporting-and-payment">Reporting and Payment</h2>
          <p>
            Employers must remit the withheld tax to the State no later than 10
            days after the end of the month. Annual salary and tax statements
            must be provided to employees and forwarded to the Ministry of
            Finance. Monthly wage withholding reports and deposit forms must be
            filed with payments due at Da Afghanistan Bank.
          </p>

          <h2 id="employees-responsibility">Employee's Responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            Employees with a single job have no further filing requirements.
            Those with additional income must file an individual income tax
            return and can credit the withheld tax against their total tax
            liability.
          </p>

          <h2 id="enforcement-provisions">Enforcement Provisions</h2>
          <p>
            Non-compliance may result in administrative actions by the Ministry
            of Finance, including fines, penalties, and prosecution.
          </p>
