## Introduction
The Income Tax Law 2009 has modified some applications of the wage withholding tax. This guide outlines those changes and provides assistance in complying with the law.

## Who Must Withhold?
Legal and natural persons with two or more employees during any month of the tax year must withhold tax from employees whose income exceeds the threshold discussed in Article 58 of the Income Tax Law. Legal entities include partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies, government agencies, and charitable institutions.

## What Payments are Subject to Withholding?
Payments to employees in the form of salaries and wages for work provided are subject to withholding. This includes regular pay, overtime pay, cash allowances (e.g., food and transportation), and non-cash payments for services. Refer to Public Ruling 1384/6 for detailed information.

## Who is Subject to Withholding?
All resident and non-resident employees in Afghanistan whose salaries exceed the tax threshold of AFN 5000 per month or equivalent. Non-resident employees are exempt if their home country provides the same exemption to Afghan residents. Refer to agreements, treaties, or protocols for foreign government and international organization employees.

## Employee vs. Independent Contractor
For tax purposes, employees are liable for wage withholding tax while independent contractors are not. Determination is based on the nature of service provision rather than the contract terms. Refer to Public Ruling 1385/5 for more information.

## Resident vs. Non-Resident
A natural person is a resident of Afghanistan if:
1. The principal home is in Afghanistan at any time during the year.
2. The person is present in Afghanistan for 183 days in the tax year.
3. The person is an employee or official of the Afghan government posted abroad.

Non-residents are taxed on Afghan-source income only.
